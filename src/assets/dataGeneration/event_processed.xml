 As Strauss’s symphonic poem Also sprach Zarathustra opens the film, apes are seen living a raw life in the prehistoric times. Suddenly a monolith appears, triggering us to ask, if this is ground zero of humankind evolution? Fast-forwarding to the era of space travelling, a spacecraft is seen propelling into the vast universe, embarking on an exploration accompanied by The Blue Danube. The mysterious monolith then reappears on the Moon, sending signals to Jupiter. To unlock the mystery, the five-men crew switches gears and heads to Jupiter, however, as the supercomputer HAL 9000 pilots the ship, a malfunction brings the astronauts into an unprecedented crisis. For this epochal sci-fi masterpiece of immense imagination, Kubrick worked with sci-fi novelist Arthur C. Clarke to create a voyage beginning with our prehistoric ape-ancestry past, and leaping into the future with the birth of the Starchild — an ultimate reflection on human evolution and existence. Then through an episode of computer mutiny to interrogate the encroaching dominance and threat of technologies towards mankind. The vision of the story is profoundly magnificent. The film was produced when computer-generated imagery (CGI) did not exist, nevertheless, the visuals were stunningly outstanding back then, and are still breathtaking as of today.

 Squadron Leader Peter is trapped in a blazing bomber without a parachute. Preparing to die, he calls over radio and operator June picks up, listening to his last words — but the farewell is a bit too soon. Peter miraculously survives the jump out of the plane as the guiding angel misses him in the thick fog. Peter meets June and they fall in love, but his worsening concussion needs a surgery to cure. The heaven seizes the opportunity and tries to bring him to the other world whilst he undergoes the dangerous operation. Peter must now appeal before god for the love of his life and fight to stay alive on Earth.This imaginative fantastical classic by Powell and Pressburger has a witty and humorous take on life and death. The interesting comparison between the colourful Earth and the black and white heaven even gets the angel to remark: “One is starved for Technicolor up there.” The grand staircase leading up to heaven is decorated as a hall of fame; and the trial Peter goes through is a typical court drama, one that requires a defense attorney and a testimony to prove his true love. Regarding facing death, this film can be cross-referenced with &gt;After Life. Post-screening talk in Cantonese by Horace Chan Speaker: Horace Chan

 The landing of the space capsule on the eye of the Moon has become the film’s most iconic scene in cinema history. A Trip to the Moon is undoubtedly the forerunner of sci-fi film, which got its inspiration from novels From the Earth to the Moon and its sequel Around the Moon by Jules Verne, who is regarded as the father of science fiction. Director Georges Méliès used to be a magician, and he brought his tricks into filmmaking, where he created adventures on the silver screen with his wild imagination. Méliès himself starred as the professor in the film, in which he works with five other astrologists to build a spacecraft that looks like a bullet, and is being fired into space with a mega-size cannon. As they landed on the Moon, the exhausted astronomers fell asleep directly on the ground and miss the goddess of the Moon and Saturn, the god of agriculture. They then witness an umbrella turning into a giant mushroom, and are abducted by an alien, an inhabitant of the Moon; the astronomers eventually return to the Earth after a series of unusual encounters and danger. Méliès’ self-invented special effects brought the audience to the Moon more than a century ago, and his legacy passes on through his bold exploration on the infinite potentialities in filmmaking. Post-screening Talk in Cantonese Speaker will introduce the production background of A Trip to the Moon and how advancing technology helped the development and popularisation of filmmaking.

 “We need you to select one memory that was most meaningful or precious to you.” There is a station between earth and heaven, and the deceased are granted a seven-day window here. Mochizuki and Shiori work for the station, and are busy collecting precious memories from the newly deceased, which will be made into a video. Once the videos are shown on the sixth day, the souls will depart for heaven with their selected memory. One remembers eating onigiris with their parents in the bamboo forest after a massive earthquake happened in their childhood, one recalls themselves flying a plane through the clouds during aviation training, and one struggles to choose the most meaningful memory before due. To Mochizuki and Shiori, this seven-day experience is the most valuable to them. A signature work by Hirokazu Kore-eda filled with lingering poetic visuals, leaving audience to ponder on death and departure from a different perspective. Before shooting, the production team interviewed 500 people in various locations, and selected 10 of them for cameos to talk about their real memories. The film is therefore a marriage of fiction and facts. Though the story belongs to the fantasy genre, it strongly illustrates a sense of everyday life. The video recording of memories resembles the shooting of a film, which act as Kore-eda’s tribute towards filmmakers. Viewers may cross reference the film with A Matter of Life and Death to read into the idea of facing death.

A plastic surgeon is set to help her. But she cannot come up with the money for the costly procedure.

 A scary story runs through the mouse family who lives underground: when the grizzly bears wake up from hibernation, they will eat anything they see, and mice are their favourite dish. Bears and mice are archenemies, except for this pair: Ernest and Celestine. Ernest is a bear who lives on the fringes of bear society as a street clown, and he wakes up from hibernation without any food; little mouse Celestine is a dental apprentice who loves to draw and aspires to become an artist, and she does not believe that all bears are wicked. The two break their own family traditions and become each other’s best friend. Together, the duo embarks on a journey of companionship and fantastical adventures. The hand drawn and watercolour-like animation retains the original style of drawing based on a classic series of children’s books published by Belgian author and illustrator Gabrielle Vincent, while Celestine’s cheerful personality takes its roots from My Neighbour Totoro (1988) and Kiki’s Delivery Service (1989) by Hayao Miyazaki. This imaginative film is a simple and adorable tale about friendship that is not bound by species and eliminating prejudices. It is an animation full of love and suitable for all ages.

 Caleb Smith, a programmer at a huge internet company, wins a staff lottery that gives him the chance to spend a week at the private mountain estate of the CEO, Nathan Bateman. The estate turns out to be a secret scientific research base, installed with an advanced artificial intelligence security system. Bateman has built a beautiful humanoid robot named Ava, and Caleb has been chosen to be the human component in a Turing test to determine whether she possesses human emotions and thinking, and if she can confuse Caleb with her capabilities that she might actually be a real person. To Caleb’s surprise, he slowly starts to sympathise Ava, and even begin plotting her escape. Debut of British director Alex Garland, the film unveils the discomfort and distrust of human beings towards AI technologies through its psychological thriller plot design, as the conflicts and struggles within the enclosed estate fuel the dramas with secrets, tests, and lies. Ava was set to be a female, resembling the femme fatale in classic film noir; while Bateman’s decision to build a lady robot serves to reflect the delusion of men’s objectification of female, and discusses the awakening of female’s self-awareness. Post-screening Seminar in Cantonese Seminar 1: The Magic of Imagination Innovation grows from imagination. Science fiction has always been a popular genre for its potentiality to keep broadening imagination on one hand, while being an honest reflection of our hope and fear towards scientific advancement on the other. Ex Machina is an example of sci-fi thriller which discusses how AI technology evolves and becomes a threat that breaks free from human control, evoking our imagination and reflection. Novelist Kevin Yan and psychologist Dr Ken Fung will unfold the magic of imagination and talk about why imagination is the key to the future.

 Spaceship C-57D landed on planet Altair IV for a rescue mission to search for an expedition that has lost contact for 20 years. The planet has its own atmospheric layer and an oxygen level even higher than that of the Earth, but surprisingly, no civilisation has ever been born. The landed astronomers are met by Robby the Robot, whose advanced technology allows it to communicate in over a hundred languages. Guided by Robby, they arrive at Dr Edward Morbius’s research base, only to find that the rest of the expedition have been killed by a mysterious dark force. Dr Morbius survives the hunt and has single-handedly raised his daughter, who is now already a grown-up. He warns the rescue team that tragedy will happen again if they stay, as a heavy price will be paid to uncover the secrets of this planet. The film is based on a science fiction novel inspired by Shakespeare’s The Tempest, as the planet resembles the remote island where the Duke of Milan and his daughter are stranded on, and Robby is Ariel the spirit. The appearance of Robby has become the archetype of robots in many sci-fi movies of that time, and has continued to be modelled in other films to come. Replica of Robby will be displayed at the Science Fiction: Voyage to the Edge of Imagination Exhibition. Post-screening Talk in Cantonese Dr So Chu-wing, assistant curator of the Hong Kong Science Museum will share the progress and limitations of human exploration of extraterrestrial civilisations, as well as the development and concerns of artificial intelligence.

 A spaceship is sailing the vast universe to explore the blackhole nearest to the Earth in the hope of finding an infinite energy source. The crew are all death-row inmates. Prohibited to have sex, they are monitored by Dr Dibs and treated as guinea pigs for her artificial insemination experiments. Soon they find themselves in a chaos that results in the deaths of everyone except for Monte and his baby girl, whom he will have to struggle raising alone. A terrifying tale that takes place in the outer space, where the scariest thing is not dangerous aliens, revolting robots or lethal radiation, but the gradual breakdown of humanity. Claire Denis’s first English speaking film combines the sci-fi genre with her female sensitivity and simplistic visual style. An exploration of human desires and emotions through marrying violence and tenderness, as depicted by an opening rarely found in sci-fi thrillers — a greenhouse and a crying baby. A drifting prison in the interstellar space, the spacecraft does not only lock the characters down physically, but it’s the eternal disconnection and despair that eat them alive.

 In the near future, Mars has been colonised by human and AI technologies has advanced so much that souls of the deceased can be replicated onto androids. However, when these robots “jailbreak”, meaning that they have lost control, they will be destroyed to prevent causing threat to human beings. Private detective Aline and her android partner Carlos are hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate the disappearance of a cybernetics student. As they search for the girl, who is being hunted, they are led to uncover secrets of brain farms and an evil master plan about the robotic programmes. French director Jérémie Périn’s debut animation feature resembles the detective story in Polanski’s Chinatown (1974) that sets in a fantastical world borrowing from Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (1982), with a splash of Mamoru Oshii’s Ghost in the Shell (1995). The film is a feast of futuristic fantasy that combines film noir and sci-fi. Among the adrenaline rushing action sequences, the story taps into the soul-implanted androids’ regrets and inability to truly enjoy family life, as well as human’s fear towards the potential mutiny of artificial intelligence.

 I On her deathbed, Queen Elizabeth I bequeaths a large tract of land and a castle to a handsome young nobleman Orlando, only if he assents to an unusual command: “Do not fade. Do not wither. Do not grow old.” In winter, Orlando falls in love with a Russian princess and has even planned an elopement. He dabbles in poetry and art during the centuries that he lives in the castle, and then travels as an ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, but flees after witnessing the first death in a battle. One day, he wakes up and finds himself transformed into a woman. The now Lady Orlando must face questions to her ownership of the estate and limitations she has never experienced as a man before. The castle becomes a prison, and the garden is like a maze. Based on Virginia Woolf’s novel of the same name, director Sally Potter divided the fantastical story into seven chapters; beginning with death and ending with birth, with 400 years in between. Tilda Swinton plays the androgynous Orlando, addressing a journey of self-discovery as they stare into the camera directly and speak to the audience. British queer icon Quentin Crisp’s portrayal of the Queen and Jimmy Somerville starring as both a falsetto and an angel approaching the end of the film pleasantly breaks the concept of binary opposition.

 A village is destroyed by a fallen object of unknown and turned into a dead zone, nobody enters ever return. The authority seals off the Zone and forbid anyone from entering. Rumor says there is a Room inside the Zone, which can realise people’s unconscious desires. Rejecting his wife’s plea to not go into the Zone, the Stalker is hired to serve as a tour guide for two men — a writer who has exhausted his inspiration, and a professor who seeks truth through science. Soon they discover that normal laws of physics do not apply in the Zone, and though the Room seems to be near, they must route around to avoid dangers and traps. Solaris (1972) has already proven Andrei Tarkovsky’s ability to bring sci-fi films into a different dimension, Stalker is yet another poetic masterpiece of the genre that embeds deep philosophy. Based on the Strugatsky brothers’ novel Roadside Picnic, the film transforms the treasure hunt, as well as the contrasting colourful and sepia worlds inside and outside of the Zone, into a spiritual journey of one’s inner self. As we watch on, we are brought to reflect on our souls as we fall into the traps designed by our minds.

 The story takes place immediately after the well-known tragedy of Frankenstein, in which the monstrous creature is fleeing from a group of enraged villagers trying to burn it down along with the windmill to avenge for the death of a young girl. After the huge success by James Whale, who adapted Mary Shelley’s novel into the first Frankenstein film (1931), this sequel upgrades the philosophical debate, discussing the loneliness of the monster and the complexity of human nature. While the villagers think they destroyed the creature, turns out it is still alive; and worse, a scientist who is even crazier than Dr Frankenstein is preying on a chance to restart the unspeakable experiment — this time to create a female monster. Hailed as the perfect sequel in cinema history, the film starts with Mary Shelley (starred by Elsa Lanchester) telling the horror story of Frankenstein in a castle. The tale gets religiously symbolic as it develops — the monster is misaccused as a murderer; its encounter with the blind hermit is an inspirational move to bring out the themes of love, belonging and their common needs to be understood, even for the monster/disabled; as well as their tragic fates being abandoned by their creators. The edgy appearance of the Bride of Frankenstein and its cast (also starred by Lanchester) brilliantly echo the themes. On the subject of man-made lifeforms, this film can be cross-referenced with Ex Machina. Post-screening Talk in Cantonese Speaker: Dr Stephanie Ng

 Edgar is a writer who loves to let his mind go wild while speed driving, but a car crash happens, which leaves his forehead scarred and his wife muted. The couple relocated to a castle on an island for a retreat, where Edgar starts writing his new book while his wife is pregnant with their baby. But the islanders do not seem to welcome them. One day, they are harassed by two linen vendors, and before long, strange things start to happen with residents losing their minds out of the blue. A retired engineer, who lives alone on a tower, is quietly observing everything — he seems to hold the key to all the strange occurrences. Is this a mind-bending game, or just the writer’s creative process in his head? Can human be controlled like robots? A rare sci-fi film by Agnès Varda, featuring Catherine Deneuve, boldly breaking the boundaries of reality and fantasy with Varda’s unique take on the genre. Though criticised at first, the film was revalidated in recent years. It interrogates the desires and shadows of human nature, and the loss and gain of the female voice, which in turn gives the work a hypnotic and complex overtone.

 As astronaut Tony lands on the Moon, he is surprised to find the “father of science fiction”, Jules Verne, whose spaceship has gotten there before him, along with Cyrano de Bergerac and Baron Munchausen. Tony is instead treated as the “Moon-man”, who is being invited by the eager baron for “a true adventure without spacesuit” to Earth. The baron then takes Tony to the 18th century Ottoman Empire on his flying horse, where they free the charming Princess Bianca, challenge the malicious Sultan troops, battle in the sea with the Turks, and even being swallowed by a giant fish. The film is a delectable oddity of intriguing adventures and perky fantasy endowed with a splendid sense of humour. Czech animation master Karel Zeman combines animation with live-action performance, delivering a highly stylised and rhapsodic treatment of Georges Méliès’s A Trip to the Moon. The film was based on fictional fantasy stories about Baron Munchausen in the 18th century, and inspired by the engravings of famous illustrator Gustave Doré. The use of heavy tinting and different colours as symbols of the changing dimensions creates wildly vivid and stunningly rich imageries on the screen.

 The film slowly unfolds with children’s innocent drawings. In the wake of Spain’s devastating civil war, six-year-old Ana attends a movie show of Frankenstein (1931). Ana’s father is busy tending to his beehives, while her mother is caught up in secretly writing letters to her distant lover. She becomes fascinated by the killing of the girl in the film. Her sister even claims that the monster is like a spirit, and Ana can talk to it if she closes her eyes and calls it. Believing her sister’s story about the desolate sheepfold being the hideout of the monster, Ana goes on a search and discovers mysterious footprints inside. Is Frankenstein really living in there? This feature directorial debut by Víctor Erice is considered a masterpiece of Spanish cinema, as it surrealistically interrogates the fear of death and historical traumas through the eyes of the innocent little girl. Disintegrated familial relationships in the film echo with the people’s anxieties under Franco’s long regime. The work has eventually influenced Pan’s Labyrinth (2006) by Guillermo del Toro and My Neighbor Totoro (1988) by Hayao Miyazaki. Rife with oil painting like imageries and rich symbolism, the film is a bewitching and poetic daydream of one’s haunted memories. Post-screening talk in Cantonese on 13th January Speaker: Ka Ming

 Engineer Okuyama was burned and disfigured in an industrial accident. Traumatised, he alienates himself by layers of bandages on his face, and becomes hyper-sensitive about his appearance and suspicious of his wife losing interest in him. Encouraged to undergo a radical experimental surgery by his doctor, Okuyama gets a face transplant created from the mold of a stranger, to observe whether his personality and behaviour will change following the literal facelift. The new face brings about a new life; Okuyama’s darker temptation unleashes as he puts his wife through a test of seduction with his new persona. A Japanese New Wave masterpiece adapted from a novel of the same name written by Kobo Abe, director Hiroshi Teshigahara used bold creativity and surrealistic atmosphere to reflect the loss of identity and angst of modern people, which is represented by Okuyama’s exploration of freedom and isolation while wearing the prosthetic mask. A face is more than flesh as it is also a means of connection with others and self-communication. The role of a scar-faced young lady reminds us of the history of atomic bombing as she anxiously worries about the coming of another war. Post-screening Talk in Cantonese Speaker: Matthew Cheng

 Humankind has evacuated the earth due to severe pollutions. While the humans are orbiting in the universe in a state-of-the-art spaceship, mountains of wastes have been left behind on the home planet. A model of robot called WALL-E is designed to take care of the mess. After 700 years, the WALL-Es gradually break down and only one of them remains. Diligent and committed to his job, he begins to develop a personality – one that knows how to repair himself, with curiosity. One day, a new robot with the latest design called EVE is sent to earth, and WALL-E is eager to befriend her. The duo even successfully finds signs of the earth rejuvenating. A sci-fi masterpiece by Pixar, with stunning visuals depicting the massive ruins on earth. The film has almost no dialogue in the first 10 minutes, all it has are extremely rich details that capture our minds. The plot is more than a reminder to treasure our home planet, it also mocks excessive consumer behaviours, overly dependent on electronic devices, and overwhelming advertisement placements. The appearance of the supercomputer in the spacecraft and the melodies of Also sprach Zarathustra in the soundtrack are designed to pay tribute to 2001: A Space Odyssey.

 Together with renowned&amp;nbsp;rock band Hanggai and the Changsha Symphony Orchestra, Tan Dun will take the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, dubbed "the father of classical music", as a medium for a dialogue with the Mongolian rock music along with digital animation and multimedia technology.&amp;nbsp; It will give audiences an exceptional auditory feast that connects East and West, past and future, as well as technology and nature ecology. The music pieces such as "The Rising Sun", " Invention - Four Seasons" and "Grassland My Beautiful Home" possesses an embodied connection to the landscapes of grassland, mountain and river that will deliver the message of protecting nature to the theatre-goers.&amp;nbsp; In addition, singer-songwriter Tan Weiwei will perform the work&amp;nbsp;in a symphonic setting with rustic traditional oriental vocal style.

 The White Monkey Steals Celestial Peaches (Guangdong) A white monkey ascends to the Heavenly Realm to steal celestial peaches in order to cure his mother's illness. Along the way, he encounters the fire god who tries to stop him, but the white monkey ultimately triumphs. White monkey: Huang Chunqiang Kneeling by the Pond from The Lioness Roars (Hong Kong) Chen Jichang is a man torn between fear of his wife and the many seductions beyond family life. One day, he has a chance encounter in the rain with Su Qincao. But his secret is seen through by his wife, Liu Yue’e. As a result, he is punished to kneel by the lotus pond to make penance for his mistakes. This play has a witty and entertaining story and the sung arias are vivid and tuneful. Chen Jichang: Sun Kim Long Liu Yue’e: Tang Mi-ling Liu Xiang: Wan Yuk-yu Su Dongpo: Wan Yiu-sing A United Front to Defeat Cao Cao (Hong Kong) The story is taken from the classic novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Before the Battle of Chibi, Zhou Yu feigns illness, and Zhuge Liang goes to visit him. Zhuge is well aware of the deception, but he uses the pretext of helping him to recover and ‘examines’ him. His proposed cure is a prescription containing only sixteen words: "To defeat Cao, use a fire attack; all is ready, only waiting for the east wind." This excerpt excels with the scheming interactions between Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang on both parts. Their responsory arias demonstrate the contending intents in both strategists. Zhou Yu: Lee Lung Zhuge Liang: Sun Kim Long Under the Umbrella (Guangdong) A scholar Jiang Shilong and a high-born lady, Ruilan, daughter of a high-level minister, are separated from their respective families as they escape from a political upheaval. They meet in the rain, and Ruilan, in her desperation, grabs Shilong’s umbrella to seek his assistance. From that moment on, they support each other on their journey. When they part ways, Ruilan gifts him a hairpin as a pledge of love. Jiang Shilong: Peng Qinghua Wang Ruilan: Jiang Wenduan Smashing the Royal Palanquin (Macao) Hai Rui is the Imperial Censor-in-Chief known for his integrity. He finds out that Yan Shifan, a high-ranking official, has committed numerous appalling crimes and so puts him in prison. Yan’s father, the Imperial Tutor Yan Song, wants to intervene by gate-crashing the trial. Hai Rui gives Yan Song a good caning and expels him from the courtroom. Shifan’s elder sister, Imperial Concubine Yan, hears of this, and comes on a rampage to demand release of her brother. She tries such tactics as intimidating and bribing Hai Rui. All her efforts prove futile, leading her to disrupt the court in frustration. Since Hai Rui cannot legally punish a senior consort of the emperor, he orders the bailiffs to smash her palanquin to quell her self-important airs. She cannot but leave. Hai Rui: Peng Chiquan Imperial Concubine Yan: Zeng Hui A Perfect Union from The Strange Encounters of Liu Yi (Guangdong) A scholar Liu Yi is asked by the Dragon Princess to deliver a letter to her father the Dragon King. While she is deeply grateful for his righteousness and good deed, Liu, on the other hand, cannot stop thinking about her after he returns home. The Dragon Princess transforms into a fisherwoman, while her younger brother takes on the role of a matchmaker and offers to bring the two together. Liu's mother is delighted by the beauty and diligence of the fisherwoman and strongly encourages her son to marry her. The two lovers finally meet again. They celebrate their perfect union and live happily ever after. Liu Yi: Wen Ruqing Dragon Princess: Zeng Xiaomin

 "Tritschler confirms his credentials as a natural in Lieder. His is a voice of spring, fresh and easy on the ear” Gramophone “One of the most sensitive and musical of today’s younger Lieder interpreters” (The Telegraph) Robin Tritschler returns for our Festival Closing Gala. The acclaimed Irish tenor will be performing two song cycles – first he partners with Shai Wosner in one of Schumann’s greatest vocal works Liederkreis; later the pair is joined by the Miró Quartet for the lesser-performed but equally remarkable On Wenlock Edge by Vaughan-Williams. In additional to these vocal masterpieces, the concert also showcases the dynamic duo of Orion Weiss and Shai Wosner in Beethoven’s Grosse Fuge. And, for the grand finale of this year’s Beare’s Premiere Music Festival, our exceptional festival musicians come together for one of the most beloved works in the chamber music canon, Schumann’s exuberant Piano Quintet.

 The Miró dispatched [Shaw’s Microfictions] joyfully, leaning into the solemnity of the glorious chords, the pleasure of melodic expressions of sweetness and tongue-in-cheek sorrow.” The Boston Musical Intelligencer Our festival opens with a focus on the Miró Quartet, one of America’s most celebrated and dedicated string quartets, playing the Asian Premiere of star composer Caroline Shaw’s Microfictions. Caroline Shaw is a distinctive voice in American music, and has received a Pulitzer Prize in Music and several Grammy awards. This work, Microfictions, was co-commissioned by Premiere Performances (with the support of Interlude.hk), together with the La Jolla Music Society, Carnegie Hall, Chamber Music Houston and the Shriver Hall Concert Series, and was dedicated to the Miró Quartet themselves. The work is a stimulating set of six short musical stories in the tradition of imagist poetry and the surrealist painting of Joan Miró. This concert will also feature two beloved masterpieces for strings: the invigorating Mozart’s String Quintet in G minor (with violist Masumi Per Rostad) and the magnificent Brahms Quartet No. 1.

 The Courage It Takes To Truly Live The Life of Avant-garde Artist Derek Jarman Written and performed by Mark FarrellyDirected by Sarah-Louise Young Derek Jarman: film-maker, painter, gardener at Prospect Cottage, gay rights campaigner, writer...his influence remains as strong as it was on the day AIDS killed him in 1994. English actor Mark Farrelly presents his vibrant portrait of this avant-garde artist, whose life is a passionate, daring reminder of the courage it takes to truly live while you're alive. Jarman's works include taboo-breaking films like Sebastiane, Jubilee and Caravaggio, pop videos for the Pet Shop Boys (It's A Sin and Rent), his extraordinary borderless garden in Dungeness, his shocking last paintings, and his unforgettable final film Blue, consisting of a single continuous frame of blue, chronicling what it's like to lose your sight…but never your artistic vision. JARMAN is a poetic and beautifully uplifting one-man show written and performed by award-winning English actor Mark Farrelly. It follows his previous solo plays portraying other iconic English figures, most notably Quentin Crisp: Naked Hope. His shows are performed constantly across the UK and beyond. Nominee of the Best Solo Performance in 2023 Off-West End Awards ★★★★★"A mini-masterpiece, infusing wit, pathos, intelligence and understand." (LondonTheatre1) ★★★★★"Fabulous, thought-provoking stuff" (Bum on a Seat) ★★★★"A mesmerizing performance that moves, amuses and shock in equal measure." (Theatre-News.com) In English with Chinese surtitles
